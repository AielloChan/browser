# Contributing

Lightpanda accepts pull requests through GitHub.

You have to sign our [CLA](CLA.md) during your first pull request process
otherwise we're not able to accept your contributions.

The process signature uses the [CLA assistant
lite](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/cla-assistant-lite). You can see
an example of the process in [#303](https://github.com/lightpanda-io/browser/pull/303).
